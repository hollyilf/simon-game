# simon-game

One of the challenges that I completed as part of the App Breweryâ€™s Complete Web Development Bootcamp was to code a Simon Game using JavaScript and jQuery. 

I was provided with starting files consisting of an index.html with four buttons styled with external CSS, and five mp3 sound files. 

I was given steps to complete the challenge including suggestions on which variables, functions and arrays to create, but had to use Google and StackOverflow to figure out several steps such as using jQuery to animate the flash.
